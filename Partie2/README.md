# MINITEL 1.2, by ETNA.Sossou_M

MINITEL, a basic utulitary-tool to get more informations about your system faster.

# HOW TO INSTALL

To install the program, run the 'setup.sh' file that will install all the dependencies 
in order for the program to run correctly. Then, simply run the 'Minitel.sh' file.

# HOW DOES IT WORK

The program is really simple of use. Once you launch the program, you'll get prompted into a screen that will give you multiple options. <br>

Press `1` for general informations <br>
Press `2` for network informations <br>
Press `3` to all running process <br>

# NEW 1.2 UPADTE : YAML EXPORTATION

This new update is adding a new functionnality, you can see the data
directly into 3 differents files accordingly to your needs : Processus, Network and Device. <br>
I originally planned to compress them into `tar.gz` files but I ran out of time unfortunately. :-( <br>
The information exportation to YAML files will happen as soon as you launch the Minitel, so you don't need to worry about it.
